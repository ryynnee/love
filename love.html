                <p> 
                    <span>
                        &emsp; My love, you came into my life so unexpectedly, and yet it feels like you were always meant to be here.
                        It might be my wishful thinking and I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable. I care for you more than you'll 
                        ever know. You deserve to be loved without having to hide the parts of yourself that you think are unlovable.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  I myself am not perfect. I have bad attachment issues, I'm always sensitive, I mess up, and I have too
                        much flaws but I'm going to fight my whole life trying to treat you better than anyone else, because I don't want
                        to lose you. When I choose, it'll only be you. I truly love you Airil. That means I'm not just here for the pretty
                        parts. I'm here no matter what.
                    </span>

                    <span>
                        &emsp;  Now that I've found you I'm so scared to love you how I want, I'm scared of hurting you.
                        Scared that I'm too much for you, scared that you'll walk away. Scared to give you my all, just to find myself being 
                        shut out. But what scares me the most is that you might decide to stop loving me one day. As much as it all terrifies me, 
                        I still want to love you with my whole heart. Because at the end of the day, you’re the person I want to return to. The one 
                        I want to tell how my day went and share all my happiness, sadness, frustrations, and successes with.
                    </span>  
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  Airil, I'm sad to see you're in pain. I tried to look for ways to help, but I know it's not something that I could 
                        just search up on the internet. So instead, I could only offer you comfort, company, amd time if you need. Even though I can’t 
                        fix everything, I’ll always be here for you, no matter what. Your pain matters to me, and I want to be there with you through it. 
                        And I'm sorry if I sounded selfish in saying this, but please don't ignore or avoid me for too long. I'm scared that I'll start
                        to overthink things even when tried not to.
                    </span> 
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  Lastly, I want to share a line that always reminds me of you:
                        "If you are intolerable, let me be the one to tolerate you."
